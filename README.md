# Garlicoin Mobile Wallet  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JGptWWP.png" width="150"/>

This is a Garlicoin Wallet for Android. Created with Phonegap.

### Important:
This is no standalone Wallet yet. An existing Wallet Address is needed. 

---
#### It allows you to:

- save your Wallet address (at the moment only one)
- watch your amount of Garlic and what it´s worth
- see your last 25 transactions and their status
- observe some mining and blockchain details like difficulty 
and much more to come.

### Download the already built version here
Android Version:
[Download](https://github.com/pauli2406/Garlicoin-Mobile-Wallet/releases/tag/1.0.0)

---
### Platform

For now it is only available for Android Phones. 

Unfortunately, I don´t own an Apple Developer License to build the version for IOS.
Still, the code should be working already, it just needs to be build.
