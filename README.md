# Garlicoin Mobile Wallet  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JGptWWP.png" width="150"/>

This is a Garlicoin Wallet for Android. Created with Phonegap.

### Important:
This is not a standalone Wallet yet. An existing Wallet is required. 

---
### It allows you to:
- save your Wallet address (at the moment only one)
- scan your Wallets QR-Code
- watch your amount and the value of your Garlic
- see your last 25 transactions and their status
- observe mining and blockchain details

### Download the prebuild built version here
Android Version:
[Download](https://github.com/pauli2406/Garlicoin-Mobile-Wallet/releases/tag/v1.0.3)

---
### Platform

For now it is only available for Android Phones. 

Unfortunately, I don't own an Apple Developer License to build the version for iOS.
Still, the code should be working already, it just needs to be build.
