This is a Garlicoin Wallet for Android. Created with Phonegap.

### Important:
This is not a standalone Wallet yet. An existing Wallet is required.

### It allows you to:
- save multiple Wallet addresses with nicknames 
- scan your Wallets QR-Code to import it
- watch your amount and the value of your Garlic

For now it is only available for Android Phones. 

Unfortunately, I don't own an Apple Developer License to build the version for iOS.
Still, the code should be working already, it just needs to be build.
